  <li><i>Detecting Subtle Departures from Randomness</i>, available <a href="https://mltblog.com/3OsyBTB">here</a>. Summary: 
I discuss, in simple English, how to detect weak deviations from randomness, and workarounds to get better random-looking and unbreakable sequences. The theoretical background is related to the famous unsolved Riemann Hypothesis in number theory. This article also offers a strong, state-of-the-art summary on this topic, accessible to machine learning practitioners or beginners, and to decision makers in the field. The topic is usually explained in obscure jargon or inane generalities. To the contrary, this article will intrigue you with the beauty and power of this theory.</li>
