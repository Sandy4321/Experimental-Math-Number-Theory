  <b>Summary</b>: 

I discuss, in simple English, how to detect weak deviations from randomness, and workarounds to get better random-looking and unbreakable sequences. The theoretical background is related to the famous unsolved Riemann Hypothesis in number theory. This article also offers a strong, state-of-the-art summary on this topic, accessible to machine learning practitioners or beginners, and to decision makers in the field. The topic is usually explained in obscure jargon or inane generalities. To the contrary, this article will intrigue you with the beauty and power of this theory.</li>

  <b>Summary</b>:
    
In about 10 pages (plus Python code, exercises and figures), this article constitutes a scratch course on the subject. It covers a large range of topics, both recent as well as unpublished, in a very compact style. Full of clickable references, the document covers the basics, offering a light reading experience. It also includes plenty of advanced, state-of-the-art material explained as simply as possible. Written by a machine learning professional working on experimental math, it is targeted to other machine learning professionals. Physicists, mathematicians, quants, statisticians and engineers will hopefully find this document easy to read, interesting, and opening up new research horizons. Exercise 8 is particularly intriguing, showing a potential new path to proving the Riemann Hypothesis.
